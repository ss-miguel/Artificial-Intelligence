A. INTRODUCTION

These Terms and Conditions are for the Publishing Organization (see Section C for Definitions of Key Terms), as accepted by the Publishing Organization Lead. They set out the expectations for submission of a Clinical Decision Support (CDS) resource or "CDS Artifact” to and its inclusion in the CDS Connect Repository, a national repository of CDS Artifacts. Publishing Organization Lead acceptance of these terms and conditions assures the submitted CDS Artifact will be reviewed for inclusion in the Repository in accordance with applicable criteria as set out in Section B but does not guarantee that the submitted CDS Artifact will be accepted for such inclusion. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the current Governing Organization of CDS Connect and its component tools, will make no claim of ownership or control of or any other interest in CDS Artifacts which are not accepted for inclusion.

The operation and purpose of CDS Connect is described on the [CDS Connect website](https://cds.ahrq.gov/cdsconnect/community/reports), while these Terms and Conditions are for the Publishing Organization to understand the expectations entailed in submitting CDS Artifacts to the Repository.

B. DEVELOPMENT, SUBMISSION, INCLUSION, AND MAINTENANCE OF CDS ARTIFACTS

1. A CDS Artifact is developed for the CDS Connect Repository in one of two ways: 1) de novo development or 2) by using the CDS Authoring Tool development. The former provides the Publishing Organization Lead and any additional Authors the ability to create artifacts in different formats or with significant logical complexity. The latter is a tool within CDS Connect that provides the Publishing Organization Lead an interface for creating clinical decision support logic using simple forms and exporting it as a Health Level Seven (HL7) Clinical Quality Language (CQL) artifact using the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) data model for integration with Electronic Health Records (EHRs). See: [Clinical Decision Support Authoring Tool](https://cds.ahrq.gov/authoring/).

2. A CDS Artifact is submitted to the Repository by first completing the registration process to create a user account, then agreeing to these Terms and Conditions. With a registered user account, the Publishing Organization’s named Lead and Authors can submit the developed CDS Artifact to the Governor for review ahead of posting to the Repository. The Governor’s review is based on the Experimental and Status selections of the CDS Artifact. The Governor reviews the evidence, metadata, value sets, and documentation, with [Section 508 accessibility](https://www.hhs.gov/web/section-508/index.html), as applicable to the CDS.

3. A CDS Artifact is included in the Repository after it is demonstrated that the Publishing Organization has, as applicable:

- Used best-in-class evidence-based source(s) (i.e., clinical practice guidelines, peer-reviewed articles, local best practices, and clinical quality measures)
- Populated required metadata fields
- Use best-in-class value set, ideally drawing from existing value set instead of creating a de novo value set representative of clinical concept
- Assured Section 508-accessible documentation files

If accepted for inclusion, then the Publishing Organization’s named Lead and Authors are advised to use the following citation to reference the CDS Artifact:

- LastName, FirstName. (Date published). Title. CDS Connect Repository. Available here: Insert Link.

4. A CDS Artifact that is accepted for inclusion in the repository shall be maintained by the Publishing Organization Lead through a regular review of the evidence, metadata, value sets, and documentation, as relevant to its combination of responses to Experimental and Status metadata fields. The objectives of reviewing a submission and maintaining a CDS artifact are to encourage the Governing Organization to build and maintain trust in the CDS through use of current clinical evidence and health IT standards.

- The notification process to ensure artifacts are maintained is as follows:
    - Governor will send email reminder to Publishing Organization’s named Lead and Authors if no content is reviewed/updated 9-months before the one-year mark.
    - Governor will send email reminder to Publishing Organization’s named Lead and Authors if no content is reviewed/updated 3-months before the one-year mark.
    - Governor will send email reminder to Publishing Organization’s named Lead and Authors if no content is reviewed/updated 1-month before the one-year mark.
    - Governor will notify Publishing Organization’s named Lead and Authors that the artifact(s) will be flagged starting the next day when the one-year mark is reached. The flagging will occur in the search results and detail to notify potential users that the material may be outdated.
- The specific review process is dependent upon the CDS Artifact’s Experimental and Status indications and is detailed on the [CDS Connect website](https://cds.ahrq.gov/cdsconnect/faq).
