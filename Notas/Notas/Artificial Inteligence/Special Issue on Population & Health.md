The recent pandemic has drawn the world’s attention towards the various health concerns that are affecting populations at large. In particular, the focus has shifted from improving the health outcomes of individuals to managing and improving the health outcomes at population or societal levels. In this special issue, we focus on the use of technology (of any sorts) in understanding, managing, and improving the health outcomes at individual and / or population levels.

In particular, this issue will focus on how technology can be used to increase the scale, accuracy, effectiveness, safety, and other metrics that are necessary when tackling health issues at scale. We will also focus on new use cases that are enabled via the use of technology.

**Relevant topics of this special issue include but are not limited to the following:**  

- Technology assisted mental and / or physical health detection, monitoring, diagnosis, intervention at population and / or individual levels
- Using technology to improve the health outcomes of specific populations. e.g. the elderly, the young, the disabled, the displaced, etc.
- New use cases for population health enabled by technology

### Submission Guidelines

The guest editors invite original and high-quality submissions addressing all aspects of this field, as long as the connection to pervasive computing and/or the Internet of Things is clear and central to the paper. Review or summary articles — for example critical evaluations of the state of the art, or an insightful analysis of established and upcoming technologies — may be accepted if they demonstrate academic rigor and relevance. 

Articles submitted to IEEE Pervasive Computing should not exceed 6,000 words, including all text, the abstract, keywords, bibliography, biographies, and table text. The word count must include 250 words for each table and figure. References should be limited to at most 20 citations (40 for survey papers). Authors are encouraged, but not required, to use a [template](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/create-your-ieee-article/authoring-tools-and-templates/ieee-article-templates/templates-for-computer-society-journals/) for submission (accepted articles will ultimately be typeset by magazine staff for publication). 

Note that the magazine always welcomes submissions into its regular queue that cover the role of computing in the physical world – as characterized by visions such as the Internet of Things and Ubiquitous Computing. Topics of interest are, e.g., hardware design, sensor networks, mobile systems, human-computer interaction, industrial design, machine learning, data science, but also societal issues including privacy and ethics. Simply select the “Regular” option when submitting at the [submission site](https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/pc-cs) (submissions are possible at any time; no need for prior abstract by email).
